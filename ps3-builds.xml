Important -
•Note: Bug* # 128008 - PS3 Bankrelease stability issues have been much improved and possibly even fixed...
However, if this is still occurring for anyone you can now use a new -tintdisable commandline to work around this.
Also, please add any repro details to the bug.
The downside to this commandline is that any objects using tint will display in rainbow colours.

**READ**: There are PT issues on MP – 346978, 346697. We’re looking to patch the build up once these fixes arrive, users on Multi Player are advised not to grab until then.

•Still using older/rolled back navmesh files due to latest missing interior navs.
•Cloth code changes rolled back due to stability issues.
•Stability: General stability was decent on SP, however there are 2 main MP PT issues that are still being looked into.
